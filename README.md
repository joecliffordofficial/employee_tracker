### Description

For this project I was tasked to build a JavaScript program to organize and show all employees in a database I created. You can add employees, remove employees, organize by manager, by department, or you can view all employees in the database! The database consists of 4 groups: Sales, Engineering, Finance, and Legal. There are a bunch of roles from CEO, CFO, COO, Software Engineers, Lawyers, Accountants, and so on! 

Below you will find a few images of the program working, a video link to the program to demo the application, and even a few links associated to the repo! 

Enjoy!
